# It is possible that some specific scoring combinations could cause inaccuracies in the results, but I chose not to address these cases just for convenience.
#           The solutions to these problems are completely feasible, but they represent minute details that are superfluous to the final result of a

#
#         Furthermore, for the code to work correctly, you need to replace the "< Enter your User Agent Here >" field with your User Agent 
#                                                     (open your default browser and search for "My User Agent")
